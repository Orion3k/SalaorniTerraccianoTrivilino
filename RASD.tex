    \subsection{Purpose}
    
    \subsection{Scope}
    
    \paragraph{Description of the given problem}
    
    \paragraph{}
    TrackMe is a company that develops software-based services for third parties and for consumers. The main service is called Data4Help.
     Data4Help is a service that allows third parties to monitor the location and the health status of individual, it handles a policy of permissions for each user and collects individual’s data from their personal devices.
    The service supports the registration of individuals who, by registering, agree that TrackMe acquires their data. After registration, these third parties can request:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Access to the data of some specific individuals (we can assume, for instance, that they know an 
        individual by his/her social security number or fiscal code in Italy). In this case, TrackMe passes 
        the request to the specific individuals who can accept or refuse it.
        
        \item Access to anonymized data of groups of individuals (for instance, all those living in a certain 
        geographical area, all those of a specific age range, etc.). These requests are handled directly 
        by TrackMe that approves them if it is able to properly anonymize the requested data. For 
        instance, if the third party is asking for data about 10-year-old children living in a certain street 
        in Milano and the number of these children is two, then the third party could be able to derive 
        their identity simply having people monitoring the residents of the street between 8.00 and 
        9.00 when kids go to school. Then, to avoid this risk and the possibility of a misuse of data,
        TrackMe will not accept the request. For simplicity, we assume that TrackMe will accept any 
        request for which the number of individuals whose data satisfy the request is higher than 
        1000.
    
    \end{itemize}
    
    \paragraph{}
    As soon as a request for data is approved, TrackMe makes the previously saved data available to the 
    third party. Also, it allows the third party to subscribe to new data and to receive them as soon as 
    they are produced.
    TrackMe develops itself two third-party services: AutomatedSOS and Track4Run.
    
    \paragraph{Goals}
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label*={G.\arabic*}]
        
        %Data4Help
        
        \item Allow users to register in two different ways: single person and third parties.
        
    %	\item Users share with Data4Help their own health status data and position.
        
        \item Third parties can request for anonymized data.
    
        \item Third parties can subscribe to the service in order to periodically receive new data.
            
        \item Third parties can receive for a individual user's data.
        
        %AutomatedSOS
        \item Users' health status is continuously checked in AutomatedSOS and in case of it overcomes a certain threshold values an ambulance is called within 5 seconds.
        
        %Track4Run
        \item Users can organize a run.
        \item Users can enroll to a run.
        \item Users can be spectators of a run seeing the partecipants' position on a map.

    \subsection{User Characteristics}
    
    \paragraph{}The following actors are the users of the services offered by TrackMe. 
    
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User:  a person that is successfully registered to TrackMe as consumer and allow to acquire anonymous data, eventually a client of third party services (i.e. AutomatedSOS, Track4Run) that allows even personal data.
        
        \item Third Parties:  a company or a person who is registred to TrackMe as "Third party" that access to anonymous and can require to access to individual data.
        
    \end{itemize}
