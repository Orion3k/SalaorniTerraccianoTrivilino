    \section{Introduction}
    
    \subsection{Purpose}
    The purpose of this document is to describe the software-based solutions that TrackMe wants to offer to its customers. First of all, the system is analyzed in terms of description of the problem and analysis of goals, requirements and constraints. After that, a solution is modeled in terms of software and hardware constraints paying attention also to some implementation details. This document is addressed to the developers who will implement this solution.
    
    \subsection{Scope}
    
    \paragraph{Description of the given problem}
    
    \paragraph{}
    TrackMe is a company that develops software-based services for third parties and for consumers. The main service is called Data4Help.
     Data4Help is a service that allows third parties to monitor the location and the health status of individual, it handles a policy of permissions for each user and collects individual’s data from their personal devices.
    The service supports the registration of individuals who, by registering, agree that TrackMe acquires their data. After registration, these third parties can request:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Access to the data of some specific individuals (we can assume, for instance, that they know an 
        individual by his/her social security number or fiscal code in Italy). In this case, TrackMe passes 
        the request to the specific individuals who can accept or refuse it.
        
        \item Access to anonymized data of groups of individuals (for instance, all those living in a certain 
        geographical area, all those of a specific age range, etc.). These requests are handled directly 
        by TrackMe that approves them if it is able to properly anonymize the requested data. For 
        instance, if the third party is asking for data about 10-year-old children living in a certain street 
        in Milano and the number of these children is two, then the third party could be able to derive 
        their identity simply having people monitoring the residents of the street between 8.00 and 
        9.00 when kids go to school. Then, to avoid this risk and the possibility of a misuse of data,
        TrackMe will not accept the request. For simplicity, we assume that TrackMe will accept any 
        request for which the number of individuals whose data satisfy the request is higher than 
        1000.
    
    \end{itemize}
    
    \paragraph{}
    As soon as a request for data is approved, TrackMe makes the previously saved data available to the 
    third party. Also, it allows the third party to subscribe to new data and to receive them as soon as 
    they are produced.
    TrackMe develops itself two third-party services: AutomatedSOS and Track4Run.

        \label{fig:my_label}
    \end{figure}
    
    
    \subsection{Product Functions}
    The main function that the system must perform are divided in three section, one for each software components.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data4Help
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Allow users to share their personal data with Data4Help and with the third parties who require them.
            \item Allow third parties to require users' data in anonymous form by using filters and offers the possibility to make a subscription to the request.
            \item Third parties can request for a specific user's data.
            \item Users can decide whether accept or not a data request from a third party.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item AutomatedSOS
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Offers to the registered users to have their health status be continuously monitored.
            \item If the system detects an emergency situation it notifies an ambulance.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Track4Run
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Offers to the users the possibility to organize runs deciding the entire path, the day and the hour at which the event begins.
            \item Users can search available runs that will take place in the city that they have selected previously and enroll to one of them.
            \item Track4Run offers also to the users the possibility to watch a run event from their smartphones using a map representing the path and the real time runners' position.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    
    
    \subsection{User Characteristics}
    
    \paragraph{}The following actors are the users of the services offered by TrackMe. 
    
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User:  a person that is successfully registered to TrackMe as consumer and allow to acquire anonymous data, eventually a client of third party services (i.e. AutomatedSOS, Track4Run) that allows even personal data.
        
        \item Third Parties:  a company or a person who is registered to TrackMe as "Third party" that access to anonymous and can require to access to individual data.
        
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Assumption, Dependencies and Constraints}
    
    \subsubsection{Domain Assumptions}
    
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label={[D.\arabic*]}]
        
        \item The data collected from the devices (position and health status) are reliable, accurate and in real time.
        \item The personal information given by the user (age, address, gender...) are correct and the account is not used by other people. 
        \item Ambulance call and information about patients' status and position are correctly dispatched to the ambulance contact center.
        \item Information and data (places, maps, paths, etc.) received from external services are correct are reliable.
        
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
    \section{Specific Requirements}
    
    \subsection{External Interface Requirements}
    
    \subsubsection{User Interfaces}
    
    The users can access to the services provided by TrackMe in several ways.
    Data4Help offer a web-based interface to register and manage the account, the users can easily connect with a web browser to the web site to access to the services.
    \newline Furthermore third parties can integrate the Data4Help services in their own apps, in this way the users can access and manage the permission from the third party's app.
    AutomatedSOS and Track4Run provide to the users a mobile app available for the most popular devices (Android or iOS smartphone or smartwatch) to access to the services.
    
    %MOCKUP
    
    
    \subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
    
    \paragraph{Data4Help:} The system should be a sever-based system made up of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A main server (possibly distributed to guarantee better reliability and scalability) with a server OS to handle the main functions: permission and request managing, data managing, etc.
        \item A database to store the collected data (possibly in-source to preserve data sensibility).
        \item A DBMS to manage the database.
    \end{itemize}
    The Data4Help services are accessible from the users through a web browser or through mobile device applications of third parties.
    The system, to collect data, exploits the devices of the users which use third parties services, these devices must integrate sensors in order to allow Data4Help to acquire data.
    
    \paragraph{AutomatedSOS:} The system is based on a Client-Server architecture. It is composed by:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A server to provide the main functions: users' data managing and handle the emergency status and notify the ambulance dispatcher through the push notification external service.
        \item A mobile device with a supported OS (Android OS, iOS, Android Wear OS, etc.) where it is possible to install the AutomateSOS app. The device (Smartphone, smartwatch, smartwears, etc.) must respect the constraints that Data4Help requires.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \paragraph{Track4Run} Also this system is based on a Client-Server architecture. It is composed by:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A server to provide the main functions: runs managing, runners tracking, streaming for the spectators during the run.
        \item A mobile device with a supported OS (Android OS, iOS, Android Wear OS, etc.) where it is possible to install the Track4Run app. The device (Smartphone, smartwatch, smartwears, etc.) must respect the constraints that Data4Help requires.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
    
    \paragraph{Data4Help:} The interfaces needed from the system are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A server OS to manage all the back-end functions. It has to implement REST API to communicate and transfer data with the mobile devices, the third parties' servers.
        \item A DBMS to manage the database.
    \end{itemize}
    Data4Help furthermore gives to the third parties a set of client-side APIs that provide an interface in order to connect their own client-side application with Data4Help services.
    
    \paragraph{AutomatedSOS:} the system needs to manage the communication with Data4Help, to analyze the data and to communicate with the ambulance dispatcher and the communication between the app and the server. The software interfaces needed are:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Android OS, Android Wear OS or iOS for the client-side application.
        \item Data4Help API to access to services and receive data with Data4Help.
        \item REST API to communicate and transfer data on the web between the client app and the server.
        \item Interface with the Push Notification service to send reliable messages to the ambulance dispatcher.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \paragraph{Track4Run:} the system needs to manage the run events with the respective runners and spectators and let the spectators watch the run events on the map. Otherwise has to manage the communication with Data4Help and between the client app and the server. The interfaces needed are:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Android OS, android Wear OS or iOS for the client-side application.
        \item Data4Help API to access to the services and receive data with Data4Help.
        \item REST API to communicate and transfer data on the web between the app and the server.
        \item interface with the Google Maps API to manage the map for the runs.
    \end{itemize}
    
    
    \subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
    
    The system is based on the Client-Server architecture, in particular the communication between the different actors and elements of the system (Data4Help Server-Data4Help API Client, Third Parties/User-Data4Help, AutomatedSOS Server-AutomatedSOS Client, Track4Run Server-Track4Run Client) is based on: the REST API to make requests, the AJAX API to transfer data. The REST standard is recommended because is largely used on the web from the most of the devices and it guarantees better portability, maintainability and and compatibility.
    Data4Help collects data from the users through its Client-side APIs. The third parties has to integrate the Data4Help API in their own app to access to their services. Data4Help acquires data from the users' devices and then provides them to the ThirdParties, managing the requests and the permissions. 
    This is a possible configuration of the system:
    
    This is the schema of the communication by which data are collected and dispatched among third parties' app, Data4help API, third parties' server and Data4Help server services:

    \subsection{Performance Requirements}
    
    \paragraph{Data4Help} The system is designed to provide a large number of users and third parties moreover it is necessary to guarantee that the data is acquired, analyzed and made available to third parties in reasonable times. Especially individual data has to be provided to the third parties as soon they require them (periodically or even with real time updates).
    
    \paragraph{AutomatedSOS} This is a non-intrusive SOS service that needs to monitor the user health status in every moment. Once user's data are received from Data4Help the system must analyze the values and compare them with safe thresholds in a short time. If the values are under the fixed thresholds the system must warn the ambulance contact center in 5 seconds to send an ambulance to the user location.
    
    \paragraph{Track4Run} the system must be able to manage a large number of users enrolled in a single run event (the number of runners for a single run can be between less then 10 and almost 1000), a large number of run events for several cities and it must guarantee that the spectators can watch the runners' position on the map with a real time update.
    
    
    \subsection{Design Constraints}
    
    \subsubsection{Standards Compliance}
    
    Individual people to get access to Data4Help, AutomatedSOS and Track4Run services must sign in to Data4Help. By registering to Data4Help the user must allow the permissions to share anonymized data with Data4Help and third parties, unless he/she can't complete the registration.
    AutomatedSOS and Track4Run are third parties actors developed by TrackMe and, as such, they have to require to Data4Help the permission to receive individual data from the users.
    If an user wants to use AutomatedSOS and Track4Run services must accept the permissions to share individual data with them, unless their data can't be dispatched from Data4Help to the specific third party and the third party service can't be provided.
    
    \subsubsection{Hardware Limitations}
 \textbf{Data4Help} doesn't require specific hardware limitations for third parties. Users should use mobile devices with sensors useful for collecting data (GPS, cardiac pulse sensor, accelerometer, camera, light sensor) even if they are not strictly required. The only necessary requirement is that the device must have an internet connection (possibly fast):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3G/4G internet connection
    \end{itemize}
    
\noindent The hardware requirements for \textbf{AutomatedSOS} users' device, to collect the health information are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3G/4G internet connection
        \item GPS
        \item Cardiac pulse sensor, other health sensors
    \end{itemize}
\noindent The hardware requirements for \textbf{Track4Run} users' devices are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3G/4G internet connection
        \item GPS
        \item Device that supports Google maps API
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection{Any other Constraint}
    
    
    %Design constraints end
    
    \subsection{Software System Attributes}
    
    \subsubsection{Reliability} 
    
    \paragraph{Data4Help} The system must be able to collect data from the users and guarantee the services to the third parties.
    Third parties can request users' data with arbitrary frequency, also in "real-time". The system to guarantee a good and trusty service should not have failure and long period of time in which the functions are not provided to customers, specially for individual data requests. Infrequent short periods of time of unavailability may be tolerated (at most a few ongoing minutes).
    
    \paragraph{AutomatedSOS} The service must acquire users' data from Data4Help and monitor the health status in real time (24h) to guarantee the health care in case of emergency. The system should not have failure that lasts for long period of time (it can be tolerated at most for a few minutes) and the status analysis, once the data are received from Data4Help, must be performed and completed in very short time to guarantee the time consistency of the health status.
    
    \paragraph{Track4Run} The service must be guaranteed to the users during the entire day, letting them to manage and enroll to runs. In particular, in order to guarantee a good quality of service, during the runs it is needed an high level of location accuracy. The system should not have long period of unavailability especially in the day time and in the evening, the periods with the higher number of customers connected.
    \subsubsection{Availability}
    
    \paragraph{Data4Help} The system must have an high availability to guarantee all the functions. Using the "hour-per-week"  (a week is composed by 168 hours) the system should have an availability greater or equal than 165/168 or using the "nines" metric the system should have an availability greater than 1 nine (> 0.9).
    
    \paragraph{AutomatedSOS} Also the AutomatedSOS system must have an high level of availability, to provide a better service is preferable an availability of two nines (0.99) in the "nines" metric.
    
    \paragraph{Track4run} The system should offer their service for the runners with an availability at least of 150/168, with the priority of availabilty for the the day time and evening hours.
    
    \subsubsection{Security}
    
    In all the software offered by TrackMe it is necessary to guarantee an high level of security, in order to respect the sensibility of the users' data.
    All the communications must be encrypted and the information should be sent on secure channels.
    Furthermore the data stored in the Data4Help database must be accessible only from entities which have the necessary permissions. 
    Users and third parties can access to the services providing their credentials (username, password). 
    
    \subsubsection{Maintainability}
    
    A good level of maintainability, since it is approximately 75\% of the cost related to a project, should be guaranteed for the development of the system, so it has to be corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventative and
    must be avoided poor code quality, source code defects, excessive technical complexity and poorly documented code.
    
    \subsubsection{Portability}
    
    The system should have an high level of portability in order that TrackMe can guarantee its services to a wide range of devices and users.
    Providing a set of API instead of creating a dedicated app for Data4Help is useful to achieve this goal, in fact the third parties can choose different OS and devices for developing their own services and application, integrating the Data4Help service with them.
