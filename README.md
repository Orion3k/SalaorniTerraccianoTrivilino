This repo contains the documents created and written for the project of Software Engineering 2 at Polytechnic of Milan.
The assignment was to write the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) and the Design Document (DD) for a health monitoring application, called Data4Help, which collects data from users thanks to the sensors of smart wearable devices.

The repo contains all the previously cited documents and all the diagrams and images they refer to. Moreover, there are also the .tex files from which we have generated the documents.
