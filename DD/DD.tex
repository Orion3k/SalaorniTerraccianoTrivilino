\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document aims to give to the developer team more technical details about the implementation of Data4Help, AutomatedSOS and Track4Run identifying the high level architecture, the design patterns used and the plans that will guide the development of the code.
\vspace{.5 cm}

\subsection{Scope}
\textbf{TrackMe} is a company that develops software-based services for third parties and for consumers. The main service is called Data4Help. \\
\textbf{Data4Help} is a service that allows third parties to monitor the location and the health status of individual, it handles a policy of permissions for each user and collects individualâ€™s data from their personal devices.
The service supports the registration of individuals who, by registering, agree that TrackMe acquires their data. After registration, these third parties can request:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Access to the data of some specific individuals (we can assume, for instance, that they know an 
    individual by his/her social security number or fiscal code in Italy). In this case, TrackMe passes the request to the specific individuals who can accept or refuse it.
    
    \item Access to anonymized data of groups of individuals (for instance, all those living in a certain geographical area, all those of a specific age range, etc.). These requests are handled directly by Data4Help that approves them if it is able to properly anonymize the requested data.\\ 
    For instance, if the third party is asking for data about 10-year-old children living in a certain street in Milano and the number of these children is two, then the third party could be able to derive their identity simply having people monitoring the residents of the street between 8.00 and 9.00 when kids go to school. Then, to avoid this risk and the possibility of a misuse of data, Data4Help will not accept the request. \\ 
    For simplicity, we assume that Data4Help will accept any request for which the number of individuals whose data satisfy the request is higher than 1000.
\end{itemize}
As soon as a request for data is approved, TrackMe makes the previously saved data available to the third party. Also, it allows the third party to subscribe to new data and to receive them as soon as they are produced. \\
TrackMe develops itself two third-party services: AutomatedSOS and Track4Run. \\ \\
\textbf{AutomatedSOS} is a project created by TrackMe and placed on top of Data4Help, which aims to offer a personalized and non-intrusive SOS service to people that are worried about their own safeness and want to have an health inspector always with them. \\ AutomatedSOS, exploiting data provided from Data4Help, monitors the health status of the subscribed customers and, when such parameters are below certain thresholds, sends to the location of the customer an ambulance, guaranteeing a reaction time of less than 5 seconds from the time the parameters are below the threshold. \\ \\
\textbf{Track4Run} is another service offered by TrackMe and conceived for athletes participating in a run, which should allow organizers to define the path for the run, competitors to enroll to the run, and spectators to see on a map the position of all runners during the run. \\
Of course, also in this case, Track4Run will exploit the features offered by Data4Help.

\subsection{Document Structure}
The document consists of five sections:
\begin{enumerate}[label*=\bf{\arabic*.}]
    \item \textbf{Introduction:} this section provides a general introduction to the Design Document and aims to establish its purpose and scope, giving some guidelines for the correct understanding of the document.
    \item \textbf{Architectural Design:} this section gives an overview of the project structure. Indeed, it includes diagrams which show components, sub-components and interfaces, underlining the relationship among them. The analysis starts from a high-level view and it goes down deeper and deeper to touch more specific entities, considering also architectural styles and patterns.  
    \item \textbf{User Interface Design:} this section provides an overview on how the user interfaces of the system look like and behave depending on the different inputs.
    \item \textbf{Requirements Traceability:} this section describes how requirements defined in the RASD are mapped to the design elements shown in this document.
    \item \textbf{Implementation, Integration and Test Plan:} this section explains the order in which has been decided to implement the sub-components of the system and in which has been planned to integrate those sub-components, describing the testing phase for the entire structure.
